# God-Level_Security
'God Level Security' is my first project, a simple
registration form where users can enter their
name, address and password. The special thing is
that if the password is already used, the program
tells you the name of the user who used the same
password before you. If sign up form values are
valid users can enter to their profiles and even
change information about themselves
